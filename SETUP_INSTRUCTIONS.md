# Setting Up Your Beta Testing Program üöÄ

## Overview

This guide will help you set up a professional beta testing program on GitHub while keeping your source code private.

## Repository Structure

You now have two repositories:
1. **Private Repository** (`bESTEEbROWSER`) - Your source code
2. **Public Repository** (`bESTEEbROWSER-beta`) - Beta releases, issues, docs

## Step 1: Initialize the Beta Repository

```bash
cd /Users/vnms/bESTEEbROWSER-beta
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Beta testing program setup"
```

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `bESTEEbROWSER-beta` 
3. Description: "Beta testing program for BesteeBrowser - Your creative digital workspace"
4. Make it **PUBLIC**
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Create repository

## Step 3: Push Beta Repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Venomous-Sound/bESTEEbROWSER-beta.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Make Source Repository Private

1. Go to your main repository settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Change visibility to **Private**

## Step 5: Enable GitHub Features

In your beta repository settings:

### Enable Issues
- ‚úÖ Issues should be enabled by default
- Issue templates are already created

### Enable Discussions
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Features
2. Check "Discussions"
3. Click "Set up discussions"
4. Create categories:
   - üí° Ideas
   - üôè Q&A  
   - üêõ Bug Reports
   - üì£ Announcements
   - üí¨ General

### Enable Releases
- Already enabled by default
- Use for distributing beta builds

## Step 6: Create First Beta Release

### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to your beta repository
2. Click "Releases" ‚Üí "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.0.0-beta.2`
4. Title: `BesteeBrowser v1.0.0-beta.2`
5. Check "This is a pre-release"
6. Upload your DMG file
7. Add release notes from CHANGELOG.md
8. Publish release

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create release
cd /Users/vnms/bESTEEbROWSER-beta
gh release create v1.0.0-beta.2 \
  ../bESTEEbROWSER/chefskitchen-electron/dist/BesteeBrowser-1.0.0-beta.1-arm64.dmg \
  --title "BesteeBrowser v1.0.0-beta.2" \
  --notes-file CHANGELOG.md \
  --prerelease
```

## Step 7: Update Placeholder Links

Edit these files to add your actual links:
- `README.md` - Replace Venomous-Sound and https://discord.gg/DdQAkUbdm8
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` - Add your links

## Step 8: Announce Beta Program

### Sample Announcement

```markdown
üéâ BesteeBrowser Beta Testing Program is Now Open!

I'm excited to announce the beta testing program for BesteeBrowser - a creative digital workspace that brings together browsing, chat, music visualization, and more in one beautiful interface.

üîó Join the beta: https://github.com/Venomous-Sound/bESTEEbROWSER-beta

As a beta tester, you'll:
- Get early access to new features
- Help shape the product direction  
- Be part of our founding community

Currently supporting macOS (Apple Silicon optimized).

Let's build something amazing together! üöÄ
```

## Step 9: Manage Beta Testing

### Regular Tasks

1. **Release New Betas**
   - Build your app
   - Create release on beta repo
   - Announce in discussions

2. **Triage Issues**
   - Label issues appropriately
   - Respond to bug reports
   - Track feature requests

3. **Engage Community**
   - Answer questions in discussions
   - Share development updates
   - Thank contributors

### Automation Ideas

1. **GitHub Actions** (optional)
   - Auto-label issues
   - Welcome new contributors
   - Check for stale issues

2. **Issue Templates**
   - Already set up
   - Modify as needed

3. **Release Automation**
   - Use the provided script
   - Or GitHub Actions

## Step 10: Security Best Practices

### What to Keep Private
- Source code
- API keys
- Internal documentation
- Security vulnerabilities
- Business logic

### What to Share
- User documentation
- Release binaries
- Changelog
- Privacy policy
- Community guidelines

### Handling Security Reports
1. Enable private vulnerability reporting
2. Respond quickly to security issues
3. Credit researchers appropriately

## Tips for Success

### 1. Communication

- Regular updates build trust

### 2. Releases
- Semantic versioning
- Clear changelogs
- Test before releasing

### 3. Community Building
- Acknowledge contributors
- Create a welcoming environment
- Share the roadmap

### 4. Documentation
- Keep it updated
- Make it searchable
- Include examples

## Next Steps

1. Complete repository setup
2. Upload your first beta release
3. Share with trusted testers first
4. Gradually expand the program
5. Iterate based on feedback
